        <p>
            Solo travel is a growing and compelling mode of travel in the 21st century. As our daily lives become more
            fragmented and sometimes isolated, it may seem counterintuitive that solo travel can be an antidote to how
            alone we find ourselves in many ways. But the very fact of being alone forces solo travelers to burst their
            own solitude to find companionship among strangers in a foreign and exhilarating land.
        </p>
        <p>
            When travelers talk about solo travel mistakes, it’s usually to cover important safety considerations, as
            well as advice for saving money, finding deals and eating alone without feeling awkward. But solo travel can
            offer rich rewards that are both different and sometimes more expansive than those found when traveling with
            other people; with a little thought and care, it can be a life-defining or life-changing event. To help you
            get the most out of your solo trip, check out these 15 mistakes to avoid.

        <h3><u>1. Don’t Feel Obligated to Stay in Hostels</u></h3>
        <img src="poze/hostels.jpeg" alt="hostels" width="450">

        <p>It seems that the most common advice you will find when researching solo travel online is to stay in a hostel
            or other communal living establishment, as these lend themselves to meeting people quickly and relatively
            easily. I agree to an extent, but also find value in the occasional more traditional lodging. These can
            offer a safe zone when needed, a bit more comfort when you are tired, and a place to unwind and desensitize
            from hard travels or constant sensory input. It can also be a more secure place to leave your belongings
            while you’re out exploring..</p>

        <h3><u>2. Don’t Run out of Cash</u></h3>
        <img src="poze/cash.jpeg" alt="cash" width="450">

        <p>Having no money in your pocket and no way to get any is a problem for any traveler, but even more so when
            traveling solo. Asking strangers for help, sleeping on a bench or any number of last-ditch tactics may be
            doable when traveling with others; traveling solo, you definitely don’t want to be asking for free rides and
            crash pads with no one to watch your back. I used to put a $100 bill under the sole of my shoe on all my
            trips; I used it only once, but man, did it save me.</p>

        <h3><u>3. Don’t Let Time Tyrannize You</u></h3>
        <img src="poze/time.jpeg" alt="time" width="450">

        <p>Another great benefit of traveling solo is that you alone set the pace and schedule. This might be one of
            very few times that you decide what time to get up, what time to eat, what time to go to sleep, when to
            hustle and when to dally. Get up early, get up late, take a nap midday—whatever. Your time is yours; make
            sure you make it yours.</p>
