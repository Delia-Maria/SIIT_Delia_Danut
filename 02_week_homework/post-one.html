<div class="box2"><h3>1. Mine Bay Maori Rock Carvings, Taupo, New Zealand
</h3>
<img src="poze/mine-bay.png" alt="newzeeland" width="400">

<p>New Zealand is the one of the world’s great adventure destinations. To really experience the wonders on offer we recommend budgeting at least two weeks. New Zealand’s two main islands each contain a wealth of urban and natural wonders. This is a country with world-famous marine life after all. In keeping with the theme for this article, we recommend checking out the Mine Bay Maori Rock Carvings. These fascinating stone carvings are located within a small fresh water bay that’s accessible only by boat. Located on Lake Taupo on the North Island, the rock carvings are a great stop if you’re making your way between Wellington and Auckland.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to enjoy the rock carvings depending on your circumstances. For example, you can opt for a romantic sailboat, a family-friendly riverboat, or a one-person kayak. These particular carvings were done by the Mari master Matahi Whakataka. Following completing of his nearly decade-long story, he undertook the significant project on Lake Taupo. Together with four assistances, they created a unique and remarkable carving that stands nearly 10 meters tall and took almost four years to complete. Interestingly, Matahi Whakataka refused to accept any compensation for his work and only took small donations to cover the cost of scaffolding and other materials. The resulting carvings are unique and remarkable to people from all walks of life.</p>

<div class="box3"><h3>2. Palm Island, Grenadines
</h3>
<img src="poze/palmislands.jpeg" alt="palmisland" width="400">

<p>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines form a picturesque island chain known for their many beaches, coral reefs, yachting, and sea turtle conservation. The immensely attractive destinations here should certainly be your list the next time you’re planning a Caribbean vacation. December is among the best times to visit. Should you have the good fortune to venture here, we wholeheartedly recommend visiting the famed Palm Island. Located roughly a mile from Union Island, Palm Island is rather small, covering only 135 acres. What Palm Island lacks in stature, it more than makes up for in terms of natural beauty.</p>
<p>The island beaches are some of the most pristine in the world. Rarely is one able to find so much luxury and comfort packed together in such a small place. There are a few resort hotel locations on the island as well as lovely restaurants where you can enjoy most of the freshest seafood you could ever imagine. This nearly one-of-a-kind destination is accessible only by boat and will very much let you appreciate the finer things in life.</p>

</h3>

<p>Like its Pacific neighbor New Zealand, Australia is another one of the world’s great adventure vacation destinations. Sporting amazing cities like Sydney and Melbourne in addition to ecological wonders like the Outback and the Great Barrier Reef, Australia is one amazing place. The country’s large size can complicate travel matters a little. As will come as no surprise though, Australia has a well-developed tourist and transportation infrastructure.</p>
